#Platformer Game
Technologies: C#, GitHub, Visual Studio Community
Description: Created a 2D platformer game using C# as part of a collaborative project. The game features responsive controls, varied obstacles, and levels that increase in difficulty. We implemented physics for realistic player and character movement, loaded custom sounds, and incorporated skins and animations for immersive character design. This project demonstrates skills in game mechanics, asset management, and collaborative development with GitHub.
